While COVID slowed down supply chains across the world, API manufacturers are continuing to build overseas capacity to supply US markets.

# 20 years of offshoring

Over the past two decades, India has played an increasingly important role in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturing for US markets.
In 2002, 15% of new Drug Master Files (DMF) were for Indian manufacturers. By 2021, that figure skyrocketed to 64%. 

COVID hasn't seemed to diminish the appetite for overseas capacity. New DMFs have increased each year during COVID. Italy however, had the fewest number of new DMFs in nearly 40 years.

# Additional research ideas:

1. Studying therapeutic class implications
2. Evaluating the offshoring impact on drug shortage risk. Prior work has shown a negative correlation between shortage risk and geographic diversity (diversifying supply points enhances supply chain resilience).
